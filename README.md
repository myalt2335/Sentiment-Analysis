# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment + Emotion + Sarcasm detector bot
# Base Model
In the base model folder is a basic model you can use for whatever purpose.
# Interactive Model
In the Interactive model folder is a model coded with the ability to test it built in already. You can simply download it and run it (If you have everything downloaded) then it'll prompt you to give it your message and it'll analyze it.
# Requirements
This script uses AI models and quite a few imports, as you can tell if you look over the code. This should cover the imports and the imports will cover downloading the AI Models: pip install nltk textblob transformers afinn flair torch emoji
# Notes
To detect sarcasm I used a single model I found on huggingface. Take it's detections with a grain of salt, just about any bit of text will trip it.
