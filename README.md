# Quick message
Hello! I created this as a side project and have since moved on to other things. This project will likely receive few or no updates in the future. It has always been, and will remain, open source, so I hope others can continue to build on what I’ve started here.
# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment/Emotion detector bot (It used to detect sarcasm but there's no real good easy way to do that)
# Base Model
No Base Model is currently available, I don't feel like shaving down my code right now. Sorry.
# Interactive Model
In the Interactive model folder is a model coded with the ability to test it built in already. You can simply download it and run it (If you have every requirement downloaded) then it'll prompt you to give it your message and it'll analyze it.

# Requirements

This script uses various AI models and dependencies, which require careful version management. Follow the steps below to ensure the correct versions are installed:

1. You can ensure everything is downloaded with
```bash
pip install nltk textblob transformers afinn torch emoji rich
```
If you don’t already have the modules listed above, this step will install them.
# Processing Power
It appears to be lightweight despite the use of multiple AI models but my computer could just be strong. I don't know what specs I should recommend for using this.
